      "2024-10-11 21:50:49,621 - INFO - Compiled answer: No! The Oval Office has been the primary presidential workspace since 1909, whenPresident William Howard Taftworked in the first iteration of the Oval Office. Prior to the expansion of the West Wing, presidents worked elsewhere in the White House. For example,Thomas Jeffersonworked in an office in the southwest corner of the State Floor (today the State Dining Room), and each president from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley used the east side of the Second Floor of the White House for themselves and their administration staff. The West Wing was constructed during the Theodore Roosevelt administration, but Roosevelt’s successor, William Howard Taft, immediately ordered an expansion of the wing. Taft’s Oval Office was used by his successors untilFranklin D. Roosevelt, who oversaw yet another renovation and expansion of the West Wing in 1934. As part of that renovation, Roosevelt moved the Oval Office to its current location in the southeast corner of the West Wing, overlooking the Rose Garden. Since then, every president has used this Oval Office.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:50,007 - INFO - Compiled answer: There is a popular misconception that the White House was first painted white to cover the scorch marks left byBritish soldiers who burned the house on August 24, 1814. In fact, the White House first received a lime-based whitewash in 1798 to protect its sandstone exterior from moisture and cracking during winter freezes. The term “White House” was occasionally used in newspapers and periodicals throughout the nineteenth century, but most journalists, citizens, and visitors referred to it as either the “President’s House” or the “Executive Mansion.” On October 17, 1901,President Theodore Roosevelt’ssecretary George B. Cortelyou sent a letter to Secretary of State John Hay. At Roosevelt’s direction, Cortelyou asked Secretary Hay and his staff to change “the headings, or date lines, of all official papers and documents requiring his [Roosevelt’s] signature, from ‘Executive Mansion’ to ‘White House.’” Similar directives were sent to other cabinet secretaries, and Roosevelt changed the presidential stationery shortly thereafter as well.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:50,081 - INFO - Compiled answer: TheResoluteDesk is a double pedestal partners’ desk made from the oak timbers of the British ship HMSResolute. In 1880, Queen Victoria gifted the desk toPresident Rutherford B. Hayes. It has been used by nearly every president since, with the notable exceptions being Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford. The desk was primarily used on the Second Floor of the White House, where the presidential offices were located prior to the construction of the West Wing in 1902. In 1945, the desk’s rear kneehole was fitted with a panel carved with the Presidential Coat-of-Arms, andPresident Harry S. Trumanwas the first to use this updated version. Following theHarry S. Truman Renovationof the White House (1948-1952), the desk was relocated to the Broadcast Room on the Ground Floor and was used for a short time byPresident Dwight D. Eisenhowerto conduct radio and television broadcasts. The desk was first used in the Oval Office during the presidency ofJohn F. Kennedy. WhenPresident Lyndon B. Johnsonselected another desk for the Oval Office, theResoluteDesk became part of a traveling exhibition and then went on to the Smithsonian, where it was displayed from 1966 to 1977. In January 1977,President Jimmy Carterrequested that the historic desk return to the Oval Office. Since then, theResoluteDesk has been used by every president in the Oval Office, althoughPresident George H.W Bushonly used it for five months before switching to a different desk. It was returned during the Bill Clinton administration and has remained there ever since.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:50,540 - INFO - Compiled answer: Completed in 1797, Gilbert Stuart’s painting ofGeorge Washingtonwas the first piece of artwork purchased for display in the White House. On August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, British troops invaded Washington, D.C. First LadyDolley Madisonordered the Washington painting to be saved, and it was taken down off the wall and sent out of harm’s way by a group of individuals--Jean Pierre Sioussat, the White House steward; Paul Jennings, an enslaved worker; Thomas McGrath, the White House gardener; and two men from New York, Jacob Barker and Robert G.L. De Peyster. Later that night, British troops set fire to the White House and destroyed many of the first family’s possessions. They could not, however, claim the capture or destruction of George Washington’s famous portrait. The portrait currently hangs in the East Room of the White House, paired with a full-length portrait of Martha Washington.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:51,028 - INFO - Compiled answer: Yes, many, many times! Today there is a marker embedded in the floor of the White House Entrance Hall which includes the dates of the four major instances of White House construction and renovation: 1792, 1817, 1902, 1952. 1792 represents the year that the cornerstone was laid, and construction began on the White House. 1817 marks the rebuild of the White House afterthe British burned it on August 24, 1814. 1902 commemorates theTheodore Rooseveltrenovation which modernized the White House for the twentieth century and established the West Wing as the new executive office space for the president and their staff. 1952 marks the completion of theHarry S. Truman Renovation(1948-1952), which completely gutted and rebuilt the White House from the inside. While not included on this marker, there was also another significant renovation that took place in 1927 during the Calvin Coolidge administration. In addition to these major renovations, there have been numerous other changes to the White House over the years. As technology advanced, new means of heating, plumbing, lighting, and cooling were installed at the White House. Since the last major renovation byHarry S. Truman, every president and first lady has made changes inside the White House but in very different ways. Some have renovated or refurbished rooms—for example, the Blue Room underwent renovations byJacqueline Kennedy,Thelma “Pat” Nixon, andHillary Clinton. Some have added artwork, portraiture, and furniture to the White House Collection—for example,Mamie Eisenhoweraccepted a gift of 1,575 pieces of vermeil;Michelle Obamasecured Alma Thomas’ paintingResurrection, the first work of an African-American woman in the collection; andMelania Trumpacquired Isamu Noguchi’s sculptureFloor Framefor the White House Rose Garden. Others have supported exterior projects on the White House Grounds—for example,Claudia “Lady Bird” Johnsonoversaw the redesign of the East Garden and the creation of the Children’s Garden;Gerald R. Fordordered an outdoor swimming pool to be built; and Michelle Obama created the White House Kitchen Garden on the South Lawn. Every first family leaves its mark on the home, and while some of these changes can be temporary, others continue into the next administration and beyond.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:51,823 - INFO - Compiled answer: President Abraham Lincolndid not sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. During his presidency, Lincoln used that room on the Second Floor, now known as the Lincoln Bedroom, as his office and Cabinet Room. After theHarry S. Truman Renovation(1948-1952), the room was furnished in the Victorian style with several Lincoln-era pieces of furniture, including a rosewood bed purchased byFirst Lady Mary Todd Lincolnfor placement in a White House guest room. Because of the bed’s large dimensions, many have assumed that President Lincoln used it but there is no documented evidence that he did. In 2002,First Lady Laura Bushinitiated a refurbishment of the Lincoln Bedroom. Supported by the White House Historical Association and with the advice of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the first lady oversaw the project, during which curators and other specialists used period documents, photographs, and descriptions of the Lincoln-era White House furnishings, wallpaper, and carpeting to recreate a more accurate 1860s décor. The project was completed by November 2005.\n",

Historians have long believed that Harrison died from pneumonia, but recent scholarship has suggested that he succumbed to enteric or typhoid fever.President Zachary Tayloralso died at the White House on July 9, 1850, after suffering a stomach illness that was likely cholera or some other gastrointestinal illness. Three first ladies have died at the White House.Letitia Tylerdied on September 10, 1842 following a stroke.Caroline Harrisondied of tuberculosis on October 25, 1892.

Harding(cardiovascular event/heart attack) andFranklin Delano Roosevelt(cerebral hemorrhage) also died in office. There were also four presidents who died by assassination—Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.

Hayes agreed to open the White House Grounds on Easter Monday. Congress had previously passed legislation to restrict public use of the Capitol Grounds, so children in the nation’s capital looked elsewhere to roll their Easter eggs. Since then, children have gathered annually on the White House South Lawn to roll eggs and participate in Easter activities. In 1885, young egg rollers marched into the East Room, hoping for a personal audience with President Grover Cleveland. When he came down from his office to greet them, he was charmed, and egg roll receptions became customary.\n",

      "With the onset of World War II, the White House Easter Egg Roll was canceled for security reasons in 1942. Officials moved the event to the Capitol Grounds that year, but the egg roll was then suspended for the remainder of the war. Food conservation efforts compelled President Harry S. Truman to cancel the 1946-1948 White House Easter Egg Rolls. From 1949 to 1952, the Truman Renovation of the White House made the South Lawn a construction zone, and the Easter Egg Roll remained suspended.\n",
      "In April 1969, the tradition of an official White House Easter Bunny was born when one of First Lady Thelma “Pat” Nixon's staff members put on a white jumpsuit and Peter Rabbit mask and shook children’s hands along the South Lawn’s circular driveway.\n",
      "In 1981, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan hosted a hunt for wooden eggs that bore the signatures of famous people and wooden eggs soon became the official White House Easter Egg Roll keepsakes.\n",
      "In 1998, White House Easter Egg Roll festivities were broadcast live on the internet for the first time, and in 2009, for the first time, tickets to the White House Easter Egg Roll were distributed online.\n",
      "There were a number of years—such as 1959, 1964, 1978, 1984, and 2001—that the event was canceled because of inclement weather. In 2020 and 2021, the egg roll was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:54,413 - INFO - Compiled answer: The White House has had two different pools since the 1930s. The indoor swimming pool opened on June 2, 1933, after a campaign led by the New York Daily News to raise money for building a pool for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from poliomyelitis and often swam at therapy pools at his Hyde Park home in New York or at a rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. The rectangular pool, encircled by arched ceilings and high rows of half-mooned windows, was built inside the west terrace between the White House and the West Wing. President Richard M. Nixon arranged for the construction of a press briefing room above the old pool to accommodate the growing demand for television news. Since April 1970 the White House press corps has assembled in a small theater to listen to the White House press secretary's briefings and reports. The doors opening to the Rose Garden allow the members of the media quick access to outdoor events. President Gerald R. Ford, an avid swimmer, installed an outdoor pool on the White House grounds in 1975.\n",

      "2024-10-11 21:50:56,349 - INFO - Compiled answer: The exact date of the first plumbing system in the White House remains unclear, and additions were gradually made over time.President Thomas Jeffersoninstalled a cistern in the White House attic that distributed water through wooden pipes. The water then descended through the floors to service two water closets. DuringJohn Quincy Adams’ presidency, an iron garden pump with “nine spout holes” was attached to a well at the nearby Treasury Building and provided water to the White House Grounds. In 1833,President Andrew Jacksonhad installed iron pipes in the Ground Floor Corridor and a bathing room in the East Wing. By 1853, records indicate that the Second Floor of the White House had central plumbing, including hot and cold water taps. By 1876, a 2,000-gallon tank was installed in the attic to supply water throughout the White House.\n",
